        <li><strong>Action:</strong> The device was isolated from the network, and its image was taken for forensic analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding:</strong> The analysis found a simple Perl script running on the device. This script was being used to enlist the device into a DDoS botnet.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The device's firmware was updated, patching the vulnerability. A network scan revealed 3 other cameras of the same model that also needed patching, and they were updated.</li>

        <li><strong>Action:</strong> Realizing they were being watched, the attacker changed their plan and decided to fully exploit the access they had.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding:</strong> They began scanning the network for other vulnerable systems from the camera. By cracking a weak service account password, they made a lateral move to a file server.</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The attacker deployed ransomware on servers containing critical data from the Finance and HR departments. Company operations came to a standstill.</li>
        <li><strong>Crisis Management:</strong> The incident escalated into a data breach and a major operational crisis. Recovery efforts took weeks, and the company's reputation was severely damaged. Public statements and legal notifications became mandatory.</li>

          <li><strong>Asset Management:</strong> Keeping an up-to-date inventory of all devices on the network (especially IoT) is critical for rapid diagnosis during an incident.</li>
          <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> IoT devices should be kept in separate VLANs, isolated from critical servers and user networks. This makes lateral movement more difficult.</li>
          <li><strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong> Regular vulnerability scans must be performed for device firmware and software, and patches must be applied quickly.</li>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>SIEM Rules:</strong> The sensitivity of correlation rules that detect activities like anomalous data exfiltration and beaconing should be continuously improved.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> There should be predefined and rehearsed response steps for every scenario (e.g., botnet, ransomware).</li>
          <li><strong>Inter-Departmental Communication:</strong> Correlating user complaints from the Help Desk with SOC alerts allows for the early detection of incidents.</li>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Risk Appetite:</strong> The balance between "gathering intelligence" and "eliminating the risk immediately" must be carefully evaluated with management involvement in every incident.</li>
          <li><strong>The Value of Early Intervention:</strong> Acting quickly and decisively when suspicious activity is detected is the most effective way to prevent a potential crisis.</li>
